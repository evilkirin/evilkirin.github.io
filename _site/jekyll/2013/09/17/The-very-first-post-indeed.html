<div class="post">
<p>This is the very first blog post I compose and then upload to the github where the blog lives. I shall not push it. I&#39;ll just say something about my recent reading and some thoughts, maybe.</p>

<p>These days, about two months actually, I&#39;ve been reading a lot about the mechanics that JVM leverage to fulfill its promises. There are something about cache, volatile, final variables and best of all, memory barriers.</p>

<p>I plan to write some about these stuff, with the interpretation of me myself along with the doubts and confusion I guess.</p>

<p>I&#39;m kinda a novice, not just about the content, this platform as well. So, I might need to sharpen my skills along the way.</p>

<p>Best luck to me!  </p>
