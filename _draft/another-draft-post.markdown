Finally! After nine months, there goes the draft of my tiny fifth article(or just a bunch of crap?). After read the articles that I write months before, the weird feeling that these sentences belong to someone else with better English writing skills almost overwhelming my little brain. Why? There are two things I can think of. One, I suck and didn't live up to my own expectation. Second, keep polishing your writing skill does pay off, and that the things I achieve by writing regularly surely can fly away from me for good. Both of these points mean that I need to, I have to, I must resume this 'crusade' [which would possibly change my life][1].
