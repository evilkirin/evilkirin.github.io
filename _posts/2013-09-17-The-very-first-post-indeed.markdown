This is the very first blog post I compose and then upload to the github where the blog lives. I shall not push it. I'll just say something about my recent reading and some thoughts, maybe.

These days, about two months actually, I've been reading a lot about the mechanics that JVM leverage to fulfill its promises. There are something about cache, volatile, final variables and best of all, memory barriers.

I plan to write some about these stuff, with the interpretation of me myself along with the doubts and confusion I guess.

I'm kinda a novice, not just about the content, this platform as well. So, I might need to sharpen my skills along the way.

Best luck to me!
